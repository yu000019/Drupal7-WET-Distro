OVERVIEW
--------
An plug-in module to the migrate module which extends its capability to import a
vast array of content.

The Migrate Module is an extremely powerful feature and out of the box provides 
migration support for Oracle, MSSQL, Postgresql, CSV, JSON, XML, and MySQL. This
module extends that support for regular HTML files. Future versions of this 
module will also provide support for Web Crawling.

COMPATIBILITY NOTES
-------------------
This Module is designed to work with Drupal 7 + Migrate Module

Developer Notes
---------------

This module provides an extended class derived from the Migrate Module. 
Developers wishing to extend the default functionality or possibly contribute
back their code should be aware of proper Inheritance design and encapsulation.
