<div begin="9.00s" dur="3.60s">  <p>Canada offers thousands of beautiful places like this.</p>  </div>
<div begin="12.50s" dur="4.80s">  <p>And many Canadians, and visitors, take the opportunity to enjoy them.</p>  </div>
<div begin="17.30s" dur="4.50s">  <p>That is a floatplane. It takes off and lands right on the water.</p>  </div>
<div begin="21.80s" dur="4.00s">  <p>It’s perfect for reaching places with lots of lakes and no airports.</p>  </div>
<div begin="25.80s" dur="2.70s">  <p>It’s similar to other aircraft in many ways, </p>  </div>
<div begin="28.60s" dur="4.00s">  <p>however seaplanes and floatplanes do have some differences to keep in mind.</p>  </div>
<div begin="32.90s" dur="4.30s">  <p>They may be small and some floatplanes can only carry a few passengers at a time.</p>  </div>
<div begin="37.20s" dur="4.60s">  <p>With so little space, some operators won’t allow carry-on baggage in the cabin.</p>  </div>
<div begin="41.80s" dur="2.70s">  <p>Ask ahead to find out what you would be allowed to bring with you.</p>  </div>
<div begin="44.50s" dur="2.10s">  <p>Most luggage will go back here.</p>  </div>
<div begin="47.80s" dur="4.50s">  <p>Be aware of any dangers linked to getting in and out of a seaplane.</p>  </div>
<div begin="52.30s" dur="3.00s">  <p>For example, watch for any aircraft fittings </p>  </div>
<div begin="55.30s" dur="2.60s">  <p>like struts and propellers that may be sharp or fragile.</p>  </div>
<div begin="58.10s" dur="3.70s">  <p>Make sure you are properly briefed and understand:</p>  </div>
<div begin="61.90s" dur="1.70s">  <p>where to step to climb in and out; and,</p>  </div>
<div begin="63.60s" dur="2.00s">  <p>what the pilot expects you to do </p>  </div>
<div begin="65.60s" dur="4.00s">  <p>if you board or deplane while the engine is running.</p>  </div>
<div begin="69.60s" dur="2.50s">  <p>Never approach or leave the aircraft near a turning propeller.</p>  </div>
<div begin="74.40s" dur="3.40s">  <p>As with any aircraft, know where the exits are</p>  </div>
<div begin="76.40s" dur="4.00s">  <p>and how to use them before takeoff.</p>  </div>
<div begin="80.00s" dur="2.50s">  <p>Knowing the layout of the plane and how the exits work </p>  </div>
<div begin="82.50s" dur="3.30s">  <p>will make it much easier to find your way out in an emergency.</p>  </div>
<div begin="85.80s" dur="4.0s">  <p>If you don’t get a proper briefing before take off, don’t be shy</p>  </div>
<div begin="89.80s" dur="1.6s">  <p>ask for one  it’s required by regulation.</p>  </div>
<div begin="92.40s" dur="2.0s">  <p>Because water is your runway,</p>  </div>
<div begin="94.40s" dur="3.5s">  <p>knowing how to use your life preserver is also important.</p>  </div>
<div begin="97.90s" dur="4.0s">  <p>Every seaplane in Canada must carry a life preserver for each person on board, </p>  </div>
<div begin="101.90s" dur="3.1s">  <p>so find yours and know how to inflate it properly.</p>  </div>
<div begin="105.00s" dur="4.5s">  <p>Now, some people feel safer wearing their life preserver during flight.</p>  </div>
<div begin="109.50s" dur="2.0s">  <p>Ask your pilot if this is OK</p>  </div>
<div begin="111.50s" dur="2.5s">  <p>just be sure NOT to inflate it while you’re inside the plane.</p>  </div>
<div begin="117.00s" dur="4.3s">  <p>You need to keep your seat belt on at all times inside a floatplane.</p>  </div>
<div begin="121.30s" dur="3.0s">  <p>You might want to practice how to release the buckle with both hands</p>  </div>
<div begin="124.30s" dur="1.2s">  <p>and even with your eyes closed, </p>  </div>
<div begin="125.50s" dur="2.0s">  <p>so that you’re sure you could do it in an emergency.</p>  </div>
<div begin="129.00s" dur="3.8s">  <p>Always read through this Transport Canada safety brochure before taking a trip </p>  </div>
<div begin="133.00s" dur="2.2s">  <p>it’s always best to be prepared.</p>  </div>
<div begin="135.40s" dur="3.0s">  <p>For example, we know that when a water accident happens, </p>  </div>
<div begin="138.40s" dur="3.1s">  <p>a seaplane often flips upside down.</p>  </div>
<div begin="141.50s" dur="3.5s">  <p>Here are some things you need to know to get out safely:</p>  </div>
<div begin="145.50s" dur="2.7s">  <p>Stay calm.</p>  </div>
<div begin="147.90s" dur="3.1s">  <p>Find your life preserver, put it on, but DO NOT inflate it yet,</p>  </div>
<div begin="151.00s" dur="2.3s">  <p>It could get snagged on something </p>  </div>
<div begin="153.30s" dur="2.3s">  <p>and it will make swimming difficult.</p>  </div>
<div begin="155.60s" dur="1.4s">  <p>Open the closest unblocked emergency exit, </p>  </div>
<div begin="157.00s" dur="1.4s">  <p>if you are seated next to it.</p>  </div>
<div begin="158.40s" dur="4.0s">  <p>Then, and, only when you are ready to exit the aircraft, </p>  </div>
<div begin="162.40s" dur="1.2s">  <p>release your seatbelt;</p>  </div>
<div begin="163.60s" dur="4.2s">  <p>and exit the aircraft by pulling yourself hand over hand.</p>  </div>
<div begin="167.80s" dur="2.0s">  <p>Finally, when you reach the surface of the water </p>  </div>
<div begin="170.10s" dur="2.0s">  <p>and you are clear of the aircraft, </p>  </div>
<div begin="172.10s" dur="1.3s">  <p>inflate your life preserver.</p>  </div>
<div begin="173.90s" dur="1.7s">  <p>To repeat,</p>  </div>
<div begin="189.50s" dur="2.9s">  <p>Your pilot is experienced and well trained.</p>  </div>
<div begin="192.50s" dur="3.1s">  <p>Always listen carefully to his or her safety briefing.</p>  </div>
<div begin="195.50s" dur="1.8s">  <p>It should cover everything we’ve discussed,</p>  </div>
<div begin="197.30s" dur="1.6s">  <p>as well as other things like </p>  </div>
<div begin="198.90s" dur="2.0s">  <p>where to find first aid kits and fire extinguishers,</p>  </div>
<div begin="201.00s" dur="3.8s">  <p>And rules about using electronic devices aboard the plane.</p>  </div>
<div begin="204.70s" dur="4.2s">  <p>And if anything is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask questions!</p>  </div>
<div begin="208.90s" dur="4.1s">  <p>Seaplanes are a great way to visit much of Canada.</p>  </div>
<div begin="213.00s" dur="1.4s">  <p>Keep these tips in mind </p>  </div>
<div begin="214.40s" dur="2.0s">  <p>and you’ll have a safe and memorable trip.</p>  </div>
<div begin="216.40s" dur="1.2s">  <p>Be informed.</p>  </div>
<div begin="217.60s" dur="1.4s">  <p>Be prepared.</p>  </div>
