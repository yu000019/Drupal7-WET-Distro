2.  Introduction

Currently this module does very little and just provides access to the 
wet-boew-jquery javascript library provided by WET. It is planned that this
module in the future will provide a very tight level of integration between WET 
and the Drupal CMS. 


----
3.  Developer Notes

This module is ALPHA and no where near a stable state. It might be best to live 
it alone till more development is done in it. Plans for an API to work with WET
are in the works.

----
4.  Compatibility Notes

This Module only works with Drupal 7 + the wet-boew-jquery plugin provided by 
TBS. The libraries module is also required.

5.  Unit Test

Unit Tests have yet to be written
